# Titanic_EDA_Project

## Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.  
The main goal is to understand patterns in the data, clean it, handle missing values, and visualize key factors affecting survival.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including:

- Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Gender (Sex)
- Age
- Fare
- Embarked (Port of Embarkation)
- Other passenger details

The dataset is publicly available and provided in `.xlsx` format.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading** – Load the Excel dataset into Python using Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and encode categorical variables.
3. **Statistical Analysis** – Calculate mean, median, and other descriptive statistics.
4. **Data Visualization** – Plot distributions, survival counts, bivariate and multivariate analysis.
5. **Insights Extraction** – Understand factors affecting survival using visualizations and summary tables.
6. **Conclusion** – Summarize key findings.

## Key Insights
- Female passengers had a **higher survival rate** than males.
- Passengers in **1st class** survived more than those in lower classes.
- **Higher fare** passengers had better chances of survival.
- **Age** has a moderate impact on survival.
